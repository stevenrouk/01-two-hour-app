# Two-Hour App #1: Django Girls Blog

The goal of this two-hour app challenge was to build the blog found in the tutorials here: [Django Girls Tutorial](https://www.gitbook.com/book/djangogirls/djangogirls-tutorial/details)

## Results

That was intense and awesome! What a great experience.

First off, the result had minimal functionality and looked like crap. I think that's to be expected for the very first time through. HOWEVER, I did actually get some minimal functionality built into a Django app in that amount of time, which I think is good enough for the first attempt!

From here, we'll only get better, faster, more efficient.

## Did You Finish?

Nope. Here are things that still weren't done:

- No post editing functionality.
- The heroku deploy had errors, still need to check the logs there. (Might be the Procfile.)
- Looked terrible still. Pretty much unstructured text vomit on the screen.
- No 'login required' functionality.
- No user registration. (Technically not in the Django Girls blog app, but I'd like to implement it.)
- No testing whatsoever.

## Problems

- Very uncomfortable with front-end design still. Need to familiarize myself with some front-end framework like Foundation or Bootstrap.
- Not a ton of experience with either Django or Heroku, which means Googling around for how to do things.
